First post of what I'm hoping to be many, many more. 

### Briefly About Me

I started working in the IT industry in 2002 in IT Operations, then moved to System Administration (Linux).

### Why This Site?

Everyone involved in the IT industry in Operations or Development would know everything can be seen as a problem, and we work on solving these problems with the skills and knowlege that we have.
Need to build a new system? it can be considered a problem with solution (or solutions). Need to automate a manual process? is a script a solution?

We all faced a number of problems and needed to come up with solutions, some good, some bad, but in many cases, it's common to search the web to see if someone has hit the same issue and if they offer a solution or workaround.

This is only fair that I share my experience with the rest of the community and if these articles help anyone, then great.
